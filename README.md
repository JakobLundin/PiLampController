# PiLampController

Client side of Raspberry Pi Lamp:

Two lamps are set up with a raspberry pi connected to an LED. When one lamp is pressed, the other lights up momentarily. 
This is made as a cute christmas present for my sister living in Berlin, so we can just tap the lamp to show we're thinking of the other.
